# google-homepage

Thanks for checking out my mock up of the Google home page. At first this was a little daunting as a mini-project for TOP, but I just took it step by step. I wanted to test out using the grid function within CSS and did as such for the logo/search bar compontent of the site. I am still having some issues having it centered horizontally on the page, but I will continue researching possible solutions to fix it. 

This project helped me learn a couple things. 
    1. The old verbage "How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time" *insert laugh track here*, really rang true here for me. Eventhough the Google home page is relatively simple, for a new programmer, it was a bit overwhelming. However, I just worked on a certain component of the page until it was functioning correcting and then moved onto the next component. 
    2. It's ok to use Google, notes and cheat sheets. I found myself forget the exact syntax (I know now that text-weight in not the correct syntax) or needed a refresher on a particular ideaology (setting up and using a grid). 
    3. I suprised myself how much I actually remembered. I was doing TOP and FreeCodeCamp once a day for about 1-2 hours. I had to take a 2-3 week break to attend to some personal affairs. Coming back I forgot simple things like command line and git, but once I got rolling, it all started coming back. I built this site over the course of a couple days and during the time I wasn't working on it, I was thinking about it and how I could make certain functions work. 

Overall, really enjoyed the project and am looking forward to working on the next one. 

Thanks for reading!
